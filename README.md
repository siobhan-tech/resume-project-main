## Description

Hello, and thank you for visiting! This is a simple portfolio site based on the template provided in the tutorial below, Credit to **Ademir** on [github](<https://github.com/Ade-mir>):

[Responsive Portfolio Website From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU)

This site is meant to be a demonstration of simple domain knowledge of

-**HTML5**

-**CSS**

-**JavaScript**

-**Automated Testing**

-**Site Hosting**

among other things.

## Status

Currently, I have completed the base tutorial, with plans to work on making the site more responsive and adding additional features such as a dark mode or guestbook. Primary work is focused on expanding site documentation and automation testing for the time being.

## What's included

Below is the site structure, with feature branches found [HERE] and testing libraries [HERE]
